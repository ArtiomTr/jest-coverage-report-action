# The „Quick start“ guide

This guide will teach you how to quickly configure and add Jest Coverage Report action to your project.

<br/>

You can add this action for the new project, as well as for already existing one.

## Setup

1. Firstly, make sure that you've installed [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest#readme). Also, if you're using TypeScript tests, be sure to install and configure [ts-jest](https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest#readme).
2. Secondly, make sure that you can run the Jest without additional arguments. To test it, try to run this code in your shell:

```bash
npx jest
```

Or via yarn:

```bash
yarn jest
```

Or via pnpm (pnpx):

```bash
pnpx jest
```

Or via bun (bunx):

```bash
bunx jest
```

If this command is not working for you, see [how to setup custom testing script](https://github.com/ArtiomTr/jest-coverage-report-action#customizing-test-script).

3. After that, create new file in your repository, under `.github/workflows` folder. Name this file `coverage-report.yml` (or any another name, just don't forget that extension must be `.yml`).

4. Paste the default configuration:

```yaml
name: Coverage report
on:
    pull_request:
        branches:
            - master
jobs:
    coverage:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@v2
            - uses: artiomtr/jest-coverage-report-action@v1.3
              with:
                  github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
                  #   threshold: 80 # optional parameter
```

As you can see, one option is commented out - `threshold`. After removing the hash character at the beginning of a line, the action will fail if the total line coverage in percent is less than the specified one. If you don't want this behavior, you can simply delete this line.

That's it! Now, try to create a pull request and wait until the report will be generated!
